					<p>My name is Zachary Wilson Nino S. Ignacio. I was born in Tanjay City, Negros Oriental.
					   I like to play sports and listen to music. I chose BSCS because a teacher I respect suggested this career path for me.
					   It is my first year here in Silliman University and I hope that this school will welcome me and treat me well

					</P>
